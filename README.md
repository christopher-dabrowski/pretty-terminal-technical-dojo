## Follow allonge guide

My goal for this workshop is that the attendees would walk out with a more pleasing and joyfully terminal configuration.

This guide will walk you through basic terminal customizations shown at the talk and link to other useful materials that you can explore on your own.  
You can follow this guide with me during the meeting or at your own paste later :)
